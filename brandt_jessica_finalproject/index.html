		<h2 id="Brief History">Brief History</h2>
			<p><q>Where did Rifle get it’s name?</q> is usually the first question most often asked by visitors coming into Rifle. Although no one 
    		can tell for sure the true naming of our town, most stories lead to the conclusion that Rifle got it’s name from an old cowboy 
    		surveyor that had left his rifle/gun leaning against a tree near a local creek. Since then he had referred to this area as <q>Rifle</q> 
    		and the name has just keep living on.</p>
			<h3>Black Sunday</h3>
    			<p>May 2, 1982 will always be remembered as <strong>Black Sunday</strong> in Rifle, Colorado. It was the day Exxon locked the gates and more than 
        		2,000 people were suddenly unemployed. People came from all over to work in the oil shale business. Rifle’s population doubled nearly 
        		overnight, jumping from 2,700 to around 4,500 people. There were thousands of workers in town.</p>
        		<p>On May 2, 1982, the Colony oil shale project came to a sudden and dramatic halt. Workers were locked out of the site when they 
        			reported to work on Monday, May 3. Initially, the reaction from the Rifle community was defiant. But the impact was felt community wide.
         		The banks began to have problems, people left town immediately, and local U-Haul businesses instantly became the busiest place in the 
         		United States.</p>
         		<p>The county didn’t really begin rebounding financially until the 3/4 cent sales tax passed in 1996. Despite the great impacts and the 
         		stark events that transpired in 1982, oil companies brought great benefits to the communities in millions of dollars of infrastructure
         		improvements.
