    	<h1>Ireland</h1>
    	<p>Ireland is an island to the north-west of continental Europe. It is the third-largest island in 
    		Europe and the twentieth-largest island on Earth.[5] To its east is the island of Great Britain, 
    		from which it is separated by the Irish Sea. Politically, Ireland is divided between the Republic 
    		of Ireland, which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, a part of the Unid Kingdom, 
    		which covers the remaining area and is located in the north-east of the island. The population of 
    		Ireland is approximately 6.4 million. Just under 4.6 million live in the Republic of Ireland and just
    		over 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland.[6]
		</p>
		<p>The island's geography comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several
		   navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, a product of its mild but changeable 
		   oceanic climate, which avoids extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until medieval 
		   times. Today, the amount of land that is forested in Ireland is just one third of the European average of 
		   35%.[7][8] There are twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland.
		</p>
		<p>Gaelic Ireland emerged some time in prehistory and lasted until the early 17th century. The island was 
			converted to Christianity from the 5th century onward. Following the Norman invasion in the 12th century,
			England claimed sovereignty over Ireland. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until
			the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest. This led to the colonization of northern Ireland by settlers from 
			Britain. In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the 
			Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century. In 1801, Ireland 
			became a part of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the 
			partition of the island, creating the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the 
			following decades, and Northern Ireland which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw 
			much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following a political agreement in 1998. 
			In 1973, both parts of Ireland joined the European Economic Community.
		</p>
		<p>Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the fields of literature and, to 
			a lesser degree, science and education. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists,
			 as expressed for example through Gaelic games, Irish music, and the Irish language. The culture of the island 
			 has also many features shared with Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association 
			 football, rugby, horse racing and golf.
		</p>
 		<h2>Places of Interest</h2>
        <p>There are three World Heritage Sites on the island: the Brú na Boinne, Skellig Michael and the Giant's Causeway.[104] 
        	A number of other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields and Mount Stewart.[105]
        </p>
        <p>Some of the most visited sites in Ireland include Bunratty Castle, the Rock of Cashel, the Cliffs of Moher, Holy Cross 
        	Abbey and Blarney Castle.[106] Historically important monastic sites include Glendalough and Clonmacnoise, which are
        	maintained as national monuments in the Republic of Ireland.[107]
        </p>
        <p>Dublin is the most heavily touristed region[106] and home to several of the most popular attractions such as the Guinness 
        	Storehouse and Book of Kells.[106] The west and south west, which includes the Lakes of Killarney and the Dingle peninsula 
        	in County Kerry and Connemara and the Aran Islands in County Galway, are also popular tourist destinations.[106]
        </p>
        <p>Achill Island lies off the coast of County Mayo and is Ireland's largest island. It is a popular tourist destination for surfing 
        	and contains 5 Blue Flag beaches and Croaghaun one of the worlds highest sea cliffs. Stately homes, built during the 17th, 18th 
        	and 19th centuries in Palladian, Neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles, such as, Castle Ward, Castletown House, Bantry House, are
        	also of interest to tourists. Some have been converted into hotels, such as Ashford Castle, Castle Leslie and Dromoland Castle.
        </p>
		<h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
		<p>As Ireland was isolated from mainland Europe by rising sea levels after the ice age, it has less diverse animal and plant 
			species than either Great Britain or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal 
			species are considered native to Ireland.[108] Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common,
			whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, 
			shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of 
			these are migratory, including the Barn Swallow. Most of Ireland's bird species come from Iceland, Greenland and Africa.
		</p>
		<p>Several different habitat types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, 
			conifer plantations, peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in 
			Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,[109] particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no 
			top predator in Ireland, populations of animals, such as semi-wild deer, that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such 
			as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.
		</p>
		<p>There are no snakes in Ireland and only one reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish 
			elk, the great auk and the wolf. Some previously extinct birds, such as, the Golden Eagle, have recently been reintroduced after 
			decades of extirpation. http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/indicators/epa_indicators_2002.pdf Until medieval times Ireland was heavily 
			forested with oak, pine and birch. Forests today cover about 12.6% of Ireland,[8] of which 4,450 km² or one million acres is owned 
			by Coillte, the Republic's forestry service.[110]
		</p>
		<p>The Republic lies in 42nd place (out of 55) in a list of the most forested countries in Europe.[111] Much of the land is now covered 
			with pasture and there are many species of wild-flower. Gorse (Ulex europaeus), a wild furze, is commonly found growing in the uplands 
			and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of 
			them unique to the island, and has been "invaded" by some grasses, such as Spartina anglica.[112]
		</p>
		<p>The algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold-temperate variety. The total number of species is 574 [113] and is distributed as 
			follows:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>264 Rhodophyta (Red Algae)</li>
			<li>152 Phaeophyceae (Brown Algae)</li>
			<li>114 Chloropyta (Green Algae)</li>
			<li>31 Cyanophyta (Blue-green Algae)</li>
		</ol>

		</ol>
		<h3>Species that have invaded and are now established</h3>
		<ol>
